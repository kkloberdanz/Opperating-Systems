Calculate a ^ b
    Naive:
        a * a (b times)
        O(b)
        
    Better:
        (a^2)^(b/2)
        O(log(b))

    // Psuedo code
    exp(a, b) {
        if (b == 1) {
            return a;
        }
        x = exp(a, b/2);

        return x * x;
    }

    always use most constrained type

ftell() gives number of bytes for a file

Midterm: 

    Default File Descriptors:
        Stdout
        Stdin
        Stderr

    Global variables and static variables are stored in 'Static Data'

    Von Neuman:
        Fetch instruction, decode it, execute it, store

    Difference between process and thread?  
    What is stored in Process Control Block?

    Process:
        - Uses Time Sharing:
            Running one process, stopping it, then running another

        - Virtualizes a CPU (Program things it has the whole CPU)

        - Comprising of a Process:
            Memory (address space)
                Instructions
                Data Section

            Registers:
                Program counter
                Stack pointer

        - States
            Running
                - Running on a processor

            Ready
                - A process is ready to run but for some reason the OS has 
                  chosen not to run it at this given moment

            Blocked
                - A process has performed some kind of operation
                - When a process initiates an I/O request to a disk,
                  it becomes blocked and thus some other process can
                  use the processor
